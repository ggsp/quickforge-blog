## What Does a Workflow Automation Consultant Actually Do?

A **business automation consultant** is something we pride ourselves on doing well, we meet, discuss your processes and identify manual/time consuming tasks we can run in part or full automations for.

We break down what we do intoL

- Detective: We trace through your messy workflows — invoices in email, approvals in Slack, spreadsheets with 12 versions, the CRM nobody updates — and find where things break down.  
- Engineer: We design and build **workflow automation consulting services** — integrations, dashboards, and triggers that make tools talk to each other.  
- Therapist: We deal with the human side. Automation often reveals inefficiencies or unnecessary steps people are attached to. A good consultant fixes the system without breaking the team.

## Why Hire a Business Automation Consultant Instead of Doing It Yourself?

Plenty of founders try to DIY automation. Zapier and Make make it look simple. But here’s the catch:  

- You’ll build point-to-point integrations that break as soon as one tool changes.  
- Nobody documents the system, so only you know how it works.  
- Over time, it becomes a spaghetti mess of triggers and half-working automations.  

A **business automation consultant** takes a structured approach:  

- Process-first, not tool-first.  
- Documented workflows anyone can understand.  
- Dashboards for monitoring.  
- Governance — so you don’t end up with shadow IT running in the background.  

Hiring a **business automation agency** is less about technical skill (though that’s a must) and more about setting up a foundation that scales for your business (I.e less cost in the long run.)

## Business Optimization Consulting: Beyond Automation

Automation isn’t the goal.  
The goal is **business optimization consulting** — using automation as a lever to redesign how your company operates.  

Questions a consultant will ask:

- Why are you doing this task at all?  
- If the system were rebuilt today, would this process exist?  
- Can we measure the ROI of this workflow?  
- If we automate, what do you do with the freed-up time?  

That last one matters most.  
Automation frees up resources — but you need strategy to redeploy them. Otherwise, you’re just saving time without increasing impact.

## Real-World Example: From 10 Hours of Admin to 1

A client (SMB e-commerce brand) was spending 2 hours a day:

- Exporting orders from Shopify  
- Copying them into Google Sheets  
- Updating a fulfillment team on Slack  
- Reconciling payments in Stripe  

A **small business automation consultant** rebuilt this workflow:

- Shopify orders → auto-sync to Google Sheets  
- Slack alert only if order flagged “urgent” or “failed payment”  
- Stripe transactions reconciled automatically with invoices  

**Result:** 2 hours/day → 10 minutes/day.  

Multiply that across a 5-person team, and you’ve saved an entire role. That’s the ROI of **business process automation services**.
